    <i>Presenting my summer research at the SURF symposium, Summer 2018.</i>

I am broadly interested in studying physical-biological interactions in aquatic ecosystems. For my PhD I hope to examine benthic-pelagic coupling between the deep-sea and the surface ocean through not only carbon export pathways, but also mechansims that transport carbon from deep ocean environments vertically and laterally.
